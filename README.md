Cloud based Document Sharing Android Application for Schools/Colleges/Universities.

Complex level of an Android application integrated with many well-known Libraries.

For all beginners/semi-pro, this is perfect repository to start-off with an android application describing Cloud based Storing and Sharing System in simple manner. I have integrated many libraires that will give you some extra knowledge about How to Integrate Libraries. I have also used Google's Firebase for authenticating users, storing realtime database and syncing app data in milliseconds. I have added some security features for better conduct of this application. As it is targetting experience level developer, I have used complex UI design.

I have used Android Studio 3.0 as an IDE.

For testing the application, you have to Register(Sign Up) for both users i.e. Faculty and Student. In order to maintain Faculties and Students, I have added Admin side portal. If you want to know more about Admin side portal, contact me for login credentials of Admin.
